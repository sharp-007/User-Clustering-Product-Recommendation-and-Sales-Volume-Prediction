# User-Clustering-Product-Recommendation-and-Sales-Volume-Prediction

K-Means, APRIORI, ARIMA

Used K-Means and RFM model to perform user clustering, completed visualization by TSNE
 
Analyzed association rules with APRIORI algorithm by importing apyori and mlxtend libraries

Implemented time series prediction with ARIMA model through ADF stationary test, white noise test and model order determination processes
